## Task 2 : 

- Data Preparation: 
Import the dataset into Power BI. Clean and transform the data as necessary to ensure it’s in the right format for analysis.

- KPIs and Metrics: 
Define the KPIs and metrics that you mentioned. These include:
    - Overall customer satisfaction
    - Overall calls answered/abandoned
    - Calls by time
    - Average speed of answer
    - Agent’s performance quadrant (average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered)

- Visualizations: 
Create visualizations for each of the KPIs and metrics.

- Dashboard Design: 
Arrange the visualizations on the dashboard in a way that tells a clear and compelling story about the call centre’s performance. Include slicers and filters to allow for interactive exploration of the data.
